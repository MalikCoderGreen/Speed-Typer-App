# Speed-Typer-App
This app generates a random sentence from a dictionary and times the user's attempt to try and type the sentence. The app will display an accuracy result and how long it took for the user to type the sentence. All a user has to do is click the start button to generate a random sentence to type. Once the start button is pressed, the timer will fire and the user must begin typing immediately for the most accuracte time result. To attempt another sentence, simply push the start button again and the results will reset.

If you want to add more sentences, simply add more to the sentences.txt file or change the current sentences in them.
